This is a private project hosted on google code by someone else, not me. I cloned a version here for later reference. It's a google script
addon for gmail to enable the delay email sending (or scheduled emailing). By install this script to your gmail app, you will be able to edit 
email and set the time to send it later. It's very handy.
